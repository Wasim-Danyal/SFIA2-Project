### Brief
The brief that has been assigned is to create an application that generates “Objects” upon a set of predefined rules. The objective for the architechture for this project is to create a service-orientated architecture the application, this application must be made up of at least 4 services which work together, the targets for each service are:

- Service 1: The main service which will render templates used to interact with the application, this will be responsible for communicating with the services.


- Service 2: Generate a random object which will be used with the object generated from service 3, these will both be based on to generate an object for service 4.


- Service 3: Same objective as service 2.


- Service 4: Generate a final object, this will be determined based on the values generated by service 3 & 4.


### Additional Requirements
 - Asana board (or equivalent)
 - Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a VCS which will be built through a CI server and deployed via a cloud VM
 - The project mut be deployed using containerisation such as docker and an orchestration tool
 - The project must make use of a reverse proxy for user accessibility
 -  A webhook should be used so Jenkins recreates and deploys after any changes are made
 - Create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that the application needs to run
 - The project must follow the Service-Orientated achitecture thats has been asked for
 

## Project Approach

### Previous Project Reflection
Overall, my previous project met the requrements which was to create a functioning CRUD application. I deployed my CRUD application with Jenkins & Gunicorn. My initial approach to the project was to deploy the application with gunicorn in  SystemD from Jenkins, in the end i did not deploy it via SystemD, I ended up deploying it with gunicorn through the Jenkins console. This was to ensure that if any changes were made for deployment durng the development phase the console  could be changed, for example if i were to test the application through jenkins without gunicorn i could change it to deploy through python3 app.py and avoid any colliding services, in this case if a SystemD service was in place for deployment. The reason i ended up going with gunicorn through Jenkins is because of a change of VM, deploying the application via gunicorn through Jenkins meant i could focus on core functionalities to meet project specification. As well as reflecting on deployment, looking at other key areas from the previous project there was alot of PFI. One being the risk assessment. The risk assessment for my SFIA-1 project was detailed enough to meet the criteria in stage 4 which requires the risk assessment to follow a matrix. Following up on the PFI for the risk assessment, more detail needs to be implemented, for example it will need more columns to explain procedures in place to overcome the risk and potentially going to detail about the aftermath of a risk. Another key area for PFI was in the application itself, reflecting on feedback the initial database structure used by the application needed to differ from the structure of the flask blog which was done before the project. The database only had two tables with a single one to many relationship, functionally this meant that the programme would work with a relationship however it was outlined that the structure should have a minimum of two relationships. Looking back on this PFI, future database structures will need to implement multiple table relationships.

### Initial Approach
The initial approach for the project specification was to create an application with 4 services which communicate with eachother and return values that generate a random country, a city in that country and logic in service 4 which returns whether or not the trip is paid for and which transport is to be used. Below is the initial approach to the structure of services:
- Service 1 : Render a template which displays results from POST/GET methods to other services
- Service 2 : Return a random country
- Service 3 : Return a city in the country generated from service 2
- Service 4 : Return whether or not the trip is paid for and what transport is used, the logic behind this is dependant on registered users location, for example if a user is     close to the generated
### Implemented Approach
The actual implemented approach is the same as the initial approach however the only change is service 4. Initially service 4's logic would be complex as it requires logic dependant on values in a database. Though the intial service 4 was complex, it was not impossible however i wanted to implement a simpler task for service 4 so it can reflect directly on the project specification for that service. This means the structure of the services would be simplified and easier to understand in order to see how it meets the specification. Below is the implemented structure:
- Service 1 : Render a template which displays results from POST/GET methods to other services
- Service 2 : Return a random country
- Service 3 : Return a city in the country generated from service 2
- Service 4 : Return a food which is popular in the city. The food would be randomly returned from a list in the service. In comparison to the previous initial approach, the 	   service still follows the project specification as there is still logic which is implemented in the code.

### Technologies 

- Jira for agile project tracking
- GitHub for Version Control and as a Version Control System Provider
- Docker for containerisation
- NGINX as a reverse proxy and web server
- Jenkins as a CI/CD Pipeline server for automatic testing and deployment
- Anisble for environment provisioning for servers


## Application Design

## Risk Assessment
Below is the risk assessment for the SFIA2 application. The full risk assessment can be viewed here: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/12LZTFQikM4--7DIpsfTX4mA11b8i3oXAg9AW9WCVlz8/edit#gid=0

## Database Design
The main structure of the DB is a table containing the fields for the generated destinations:

## CI Pipeline

The original pipeline did not use Ansible or NGINX however after learning about the technologies and their usage it was implemented in to the CI Pipeline. After implementation images were built and push and then pulled when deploying a stack with swarm. Prior to any automation docker compose would build the image and it would be manually ran. Below is the final pipeline:

## Testing

When testing each service i wanted to test areas that users would use and also test the core functionalities of the services. Below are summaries of the tests for each service:

- **Service 1**
    - The tests done for service one were to ensure that access to pages were working and the status code returned was 200 which ensures that the request to the page was              successful. Below is a coverage report on this test:
    
    
- **Service 2**
    - The test done for service 2 was to ensure that requests to the api would return values that were intended to be returned from a list. The structure behind service 1 was to return a random item from the list. Below is a coverage report on this test:

## Project Review
Overall the intial approach was close to the implemented approach only difference was one service change to meet requirements. I think in comparison to my first SFIA project from the xperience gained i was able to tackle this project more efficently with more confidence in the technologies used in the first projects. I faced many issues with deployment of this appliation such as one issue where Jenkins would not deploy th application if Jenkins was installed on another VM, to work around this with improvements i decided to run Jenkins on the main VM as a manage node. This meant that the outcome would be the same as having Jenkins on another node however would be more cost efficient and effectie in the long run if this were deployed properly. It would mean one less VM is used and in the case of downtime or an attack it is quicker to start a new VM and set up Jenkins quicker and get the application deployed quicker as it would be on the same VM.

### Known Issues
- One test fails for service one as ir requires a status ode 200, it returns as a fail if tests are ran before the site is online.

### Future Improvements
- Implement CSS with HTML to make the design of pages aesthetically pleasing for the user
- Change display of first generated destination to most recently generated destination
