### Brief
The brief that has been assigned is to create an application that generates “Objects” upon a set of predefined rules. The objective for the architechture for this project is to create a service-orientated architecture the application, this application must be made up of at least 4 services which work together, the targets for each service are:

Service 1: The main service which will render templates used to interact with the application, this will be responsible for communicating with the services.
Service 2: Generate a random object which will be used with the object generated from service 3, these will both be based on to generate an object for service 4.
Service 3: Same objective as service 2.
Service 4: Generate a final object, this will be determined based on the values generated by service 3 & 4.


### Additional Requirements
 - Asana board (or equivalent)
 - Application fully integrated using the Feature-Branch model into a VCS which will be built through a CI server and deployed via a cloud VM
 - The project mut be deployed using containerisation such as docker and an orchestration tool
 - The project must make use of a reverse proxy for user accessibility
 -  A webhook should be used so Jenkins recreates and deploys after any changes are made
 - Create an Ansible Playbook that will provision the environment that the application needs to run
 - The project must follow the Service-Orientated achitecture thats has been asked for
